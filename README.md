## Curiosity and self-supervision in Deep Reinforcement Learning

* **Central article:** [Curiosity-driven Exploration by Self-supervised Prediction](https://pathak22.github.io/noreward-rl/resources/icml17.pdf)
  + played Mario level 1 without any reward; generalized faster to level 2
  + solved "noisy TV problem"
* **Unity experiment:** [Solving sparse-reward tasks with Curiosity](https://blogs.unity3d.com/ru/2018/06/26/solving-sparse-reward-tasks-with-curiosity/)
  + introduced Pyramids envrionment to challenge the approach: PPO does not work, PPO + Curiosity works
  
**PLANNED EXPERIMENTS:**
- [ ] test curiosity on Mountain Car problem
- [ ] launch Mario environment
- [ ] reproduce curiosity on Mario
- [x] launch ML-agents
- [ ] test (adapt?) [my RL library](https://github.com/FortsAndMills/Learning-Reinforcement-Learning) on ML-agents environments
- [ ] reproduce curiosity on Pyramids problem
